Starfish, also known as sea stars, are marine invertebrates with a distinctive star-shaped body consisting of five arms or more that radiate from a central disk. They belong to the phylum Echinodermata, which also includes sea urchins, sand dollars, and sea cucumbers.  Starfish come in a variety of colors, shapes, and sizes and can be found in oceans all over the world, from shallow tropical reefs to the depths of the polar oceans. They feed on a variety of prey, including small invertebrates like mollusks and crustaceans, and they use their tube feet to grasp and move around. Starfish play important roles in marine ecosystems as both predators and prey, and they can also regenerate lost limbs. Some species are popular in the aquarium trade, but it's important to note that they require specialized care and are not suitable for all hobbyists.
