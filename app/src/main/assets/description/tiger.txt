Tiger is a large carnivorous mammal belonging to the Felidae family. It is the largest of all cat species and can weigh up to 700 pounds. Tigers are native to Asia, particularly in India, Russia, China, and Indonesia. They have a distinctive orange coat with black stripes and a white belly. Tigers are apex predators in their ecosystem and mainly feed on deer, antelopes, and other large mammals. Unfortunately, tigers are an endangered species due to habitat loss and poaching for their skin and body parts, which are used for traditional medicine. Conservation efforts are underway to protect and conserve tiger populations.
