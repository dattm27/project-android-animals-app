A jellyfish is a free-floating aquatic creature that belongs to the phylum Cnidaria. It is named after its gelatinous, bell-shaped body and tentacles that trail from its oral arms. Jellyfish are found in both saltwater and freshwater environments, and they come in a variety of shapes, colors, and sizes, ranging from tiny to several feet in diameter. Jellyfish do not have a brain, bones, or a central nervous system. They move by contracting and relaxing their body muscles, and they capture and eat tiny plankton and fish using their stinging tentacles. Jellyfish can be both beautiful and dangerous, with some species possessing strong venom that can cause painful stings or even death in humans. They also play an important ecological role as a food source for many marine animals.
