Seahorses are unique marine creatures known for their unusual and distinctive appearance. They belong to the genus Hippocampus, which in Greek means "horse sea monster." These delicate animals are found in shallow tropical and temperate waters all around the world. Seahorses have a long snout, a flexible tail, and a bony exoskeleton instead of a backbone. Unlike most fish, they swim upright and use their dorsal fin to propel themselves forward. They also have small fin-like structures on their side, which they use to steer and change direction. One of the most fascinating things about seahorses is their reproduction. Male seahorses are the ones that become pregnant and give birth to live, tiny seahorses called fry. Seahorses are also threatened by habitat loss, overfishing, and the aquarium trade, making them an important animal to protect and conserve.
