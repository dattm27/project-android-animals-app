A horse is a large, four-legged mammal that is commonly domesticated and used for transportation, work, and recreation. Horses are known for their strength, speed, and graceful movements, and have been used by humans for thousands of years, dating back to ancient civilizations. They are part of the family Equidae, which also includes zebras and donkeys. Horses are herbivorous animals that typically graze on grasses and plants, and can vary in size and color depending on breed and genetic factors. They can be trained and ridden for activities such as horse racing, show jumping, dressage, and pleasure riding.
