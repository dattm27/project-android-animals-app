Sea turtles are reptiles that inhabit the world's oceans and are adapted to living their entire lives at sea, except for the time when females come ashore to lay eggs. There are seven different species of sea turtles: the Green sea turtle, Loggerhead sea turtle, Hawksbill sea turtle, Olive Ridley sea turtle, Kemp's Ridley sea turtle, Flatback sea turtle, and the Leatherback sea turtle. Sea turtles are categorized as endangered or critically endangered species due to human activities such as pollution, habitat destruction, and poaching. They are an important part of marine ecosystems and play a crucial role in maintaining the balance of the underwater ecosystem.
