The polar bear is a large marine mammal that is native to the Arctic region, including the surrounding seas and landmasses. They are the largest land carnivores on Earth and are adapted to living in extremely cold and icy conditions. Polar bears have thick, white fur that helps to insulate them in their frozen habitat and keep them warm. They also have large paws that are specifically designed for walking on snow and ice. Their diet consists mainly of seals, which they hunt by waiting for them to come up for air at breathing holes or by diving into the ocean to catch them.
