Shrimp are small, shellfish crustaceans that are found in both saltwater and freshwater sources. They have a slender, elongated body with a prominent head and a hard exoskeleton, which protects their internal organs. Typically, shrimp have five pairs of legs, with the first pair significantly larger than the others. They use their legs to swim and their antennae to navigate, locate food, and sense danger. Shrimp come in a variety of sizes and colors, and they are a popular seafood item worldwide. They can be cooked in numerous ways, such as grilled, fried, boiled, or saut√©ed, and are often used in salads, soups, and other dishes.
