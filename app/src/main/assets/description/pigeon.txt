Pigeons are a species of bird belonging to the family Columbidae. They are small to medium-sized birds and are found all over the world, except for the polar regions and some remote islands. Pigeons are known for their distinctive cooing sound and their ability to navigate long distances using their sense of direction. They have a plump, compact body with short necks and small heads. Their feathers are usually gray or brown, with some variations depending on the species. Pigeons are often found in urban areas, where they feed on seeds, grains, and insects. They are also sometimes referred to as "city birds" or "street birds" because of their preference for nesting on buildings and other man-made structures, such as bridges and statues.
