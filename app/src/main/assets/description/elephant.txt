An elephant is a large mammal that is native to Africa and Asia. It is one of the largest land animals, with some species growing up to 13 feet high and weighing up to 13,000 pounds. Elephants are known for their long trunks, large ears, and tusks, which are actually elongated incisor teeth used for defense, foraging, and other activities. Elephants are social animals that live in groups, called herds, led by the oldest and most experienced female, called the matriarch. They are herbivorous and feed on a variety of plant matter, such as grasses, leaves, bark, fruits, and roots. Elephants are also known for their intelligence, long memories, and complex social behaviors. They have been heavily hunted in the past for their ivory tusks, and some species are currently endangered due to habitat loss, human conflict, and poaching.
