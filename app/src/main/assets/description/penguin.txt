Penguins are a group of flightless birds that are mostly found in the southern hemisphere, particularly in Antarctica, but also in Africa, South America, Australia, and New Zealand. They are typically 2 to 4 feet tall and weigh between 2 and 100 pounds, depending on the species. Penguins are easily recognized by their black and white feathers, waddling gait, and their unique way of swimming in the water. They are well adapted to living in cold environments, as they have a thick layer of insulating feathers, a layer of blubber, and a counter-current heat exchange system in their legs that helps them stay warm. There are 18 known species of penguins, ranging in size from the tiny fairy penguin to the emperor penguin, the largest of all penguins. Penguins are social animals and often live in large colonies called rookeries, where they breed and raise their young. They feed on fish, krill, and squid, and are important indicators of the health of marine ecosystems.
