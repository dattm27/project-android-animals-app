A cat is a small domesticated carnivorous mammal, scientifically known as Felis catus. They are often kept as pets and are valued for their companionship and affectionate behavior. Cats are known for their independent nature, agility, and hunting skills. They typically have fur, retractable claws, and keen senses, particularly for detecting movement in low light conditions. There are many different breeds of cats, each with their own unique physical and behavioral traits.
