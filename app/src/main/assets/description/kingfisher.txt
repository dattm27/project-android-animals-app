The kingfisher is a type of bird that is known for its brightly colored feathers and its unique hunting style. There are about 90 species of kingfishers found all around the world, mostly in tropical and subtropical regions. Kingfishers are characterized by their long, sharp bills that they use for capturing fish and other small prey in the water. They are excellent swimmers and divers, and are able to rapidly plunge into the water from perches above to catch their prey. Kingfishers typically have bright blue or green feathers on their backs, with white or cream-colored undersides. Some species also have orange or rusty-colored feathers on their breasts or heads. They range in size from the tiny African pygmy kingfisher (which is only about 10 cm in length) to the large giant kingfisher (which can grow up to 45 cm in length).
