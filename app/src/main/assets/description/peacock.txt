The peacock is a large and colorful bird native to South Asia. They are best known for their extravagant tail feathers which are covered in iridescent blue, green, and gold hues, and can be fanned out into a breathtaking display during breeding season. Male peacocks, who are called peafowls, are the ones with the impressive tails, while females, called peahens, have a more understated appearance. Peacocks are also known for their distinctive calls which sound like a loud, high-pitched screech. They are omnivores and feed on a variety of foods, including insects, seeds, and small mammals. Peacocks are culturally significant in many parts of the world, and are often associated with beauty, pride, and ostentation.
